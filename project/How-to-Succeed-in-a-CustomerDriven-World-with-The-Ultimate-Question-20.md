The answer is The Ultimate Question 2.0 (Revised and Expanded Edition): How Net Promoter Companies Thrive in a Customer-Driven World by Fred Reichheld and Rob Markey. This book is the definitive guide to the Net Promoter System (NPS), a simple but powerful tool that helps you understand and improve customer loyalty.
 
NPS is based on one simple question: How likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague? By asking this question, you can identify your promoters (customers who love your brand and spread positive word-of-mouth), your passives (customers who are satisfied but not enthusiastic), and your detractors (customers who are unhappy and likely to defect).
 
By subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters, you get your Net Promoter Score, a single number that reflects the overall health of your customer relationships. You can then use this score to benchmark your performance, track your progress, and identify areas for improvement.
 
But NPS is more than just a score. It's a system that helps you create a culture of customer-centricity, where every employee is focused on delivering value to customers. The Ultimate Question 2.0 shows you how to implement NPS in your organization, with practical tips, best practices, and real-world examples from companies like Apple, Amazon, Zappos, and more.
 
Whether you're a small business owner, a CEO, a marketer, a salesperson, or anyone who cares about customers, The Ultimate Question 2.0 will help you transform your business into a customer-driven growth engine.
  
So how do you get started with NPS? The first step is to ask the ultimate question to your customers, either through surveys, online reviews, social media, or other channels. You can also segment your customers by different criteria, such as product, service, location, or demographic, to get more granular insights.
 
The second step is to close the loop with your customers, by thanking them for their feedback, addressing their concerns, and following up on their suggestions. This shows that you care about their opinions and value their loyalty. You can also use this opportunity to ask for referrals, testimonials, or reviews from your promoters.
 
The third step is to act on the feedback, by identifying the root causes of customer dissatisfaction and implementing solutions to fix them. You can also use the feedback to innovate and improve your products, services, processes, and policies. You should also celebrate and reward your employees who deliver exceptional customer experiences and inspire others to do the same.
  
The fourth step is to embed NPS into your organization, by making it a part of your strategy, culture, and operations. You should communicate your NPS goals and results to your employees, customers, and stakeholders, and use them to align your actions and decisions. You should also monitor and analyze your NPS data over time, and use it to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for growth.
 
By following these steps, you can create a loyal customer base that will fuel your business success. The Ultimate Question 2.0 will show you how to do it with proven methods and examples from leading companies. You'll learn how to turn your customers into promoters, your employees into advocates, and your competitors into followers.
